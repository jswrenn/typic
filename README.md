**ANNOUNCEMENT:** The primary purpose of Typic was to prototype zero-compromise designs for a safe transmute language feature. [Read the resulting RFC draft here](https://github.com/rust-lang/project-safe-transmute/pull/5)!

# Typic
Typic helps you transmute fearlessly. It worries about the subtleties of
***[soundness]*** and ***[safety]*** so you don't have to!

[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/typic/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/typic/)
[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/typic.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/typic/0.1.0)

Just import it and replace your `#[repr(...)]` attributes with `#[typic::repr(...)]`:
```rust
// Import it!
use typic::{self, TransmuteInto};

// Update your attributes!
#[typic::repr(C)]
pub struct Foo(pub u8, pub u16);

// Transmute fearlessly!
let _ : Foo = u32::default().transmute_into(); // Alchemy achieved!
let _ : u32 = Foo::default().transmute_into(); // Compiler Error!
```
